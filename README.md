# Lung-Disease-Detection-using-X-ray-Images

verview:
The Lung Disease Detection project focuses on developing a system for automatically detecting lung diseases, such as pneumonia or tuberculosis, using X-ray images. Leveraging transfer learning techniques with pre-trained deep learning models, this project aims to build an accurate and efficient diagnostic tool to assist healthcare professionals in early disease detection and diagnosis.

Key Features:
Dataset Exploration: Explore and analyze the dataset of X-ray images, understanding the distribution of classes and the characteristics of images.
Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the X-ray images, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation, to prepare them for training.
Transfer Learning: Utilize transfer learning with pre-trained deep learning models such as VGG leveraging their learned features for lung disease detection tasks.
Fine-tuning: Fine-tune the pre-trained models on the specific task of lung disease detection, adapting them to the characteristics of the dataset and optimizing their performance.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on separate test datasets.
